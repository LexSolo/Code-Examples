# Code-Examples
My code examples for performing skills.


Here you can browse my Java and C# code.

I've got one C# program.
It accepts at the entrance file you write, deletes words shorter definite length with punctuation marks and write this one text to the new file you can write too.

Also I have got two Java programs.
The first one performed card game with the computer as your opponent. It able to beat cards, toss them and emulate other functions of real game.
The second program look like TODO list, where you can write tasks, edit them, delete them and look through the list.
