# Code-Examples
My code examples for performing skills.


Here you can browse my Java and C# code.

I've got one C# program.
It accepts at the entrance file you write, deletes words shorter definite length with punctuation marks and write this one text to the new file you can write too.

Also I have got three Java programs.
The first one performed card game with the computer as your opponent. It able to beat cards, toss them and emulate other functions of real game.
The second seems like elementary shopping basket of online store. You can order different products from product catalog with values of products you want to. At the exit you get printed order with price, value and total sum of your products.
The third program looks like TODO list, where you can write tasks, edit them, delete them and look through the list.
